Introduction to Modulus Operator

Definition and Symbol

The modulus operator is represented by the percent sign (%).
It is commonly accessed using the Shift + 5 key on most keyboards.
The operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation.

Functionality of Modulus

The modulus operator maps a number to a specific range based on the remainder of division.
It is particularly useful in programming for constraining values within a certain limit, such as array indices or time calculations.

Modulo Arithmetic Explained

Modulo arithmetic can be visualized using a clock analogy, where the numbers wrap around after reaching a certain value.
For example, in modulo 12 arithmetic, the numbers reset after 12, similar to how a clock resets after 12 hours.
Example Calculation

Example Calculation
To illustrate, evaluating 14 % 12 involves counting steps on a clock: starting from 0 and making 14 steps results in landing on 2.
This is equivalent to finding the remainder of 14 divided by 12, which is also 2.
